            As part of the App team, I worked on improving the core product, a
            low/no-code platform to create manufacturing and frontline
            operations software. I worked on enhancing the app editor. I owned
            adding rich text functionality to existing text, which invovled
            creating the user interface for rich text editing and integrating
            and updating existing logic to deal with multilingual rich text.

            I worked with a few members of the Wellness Product team to
            implement a new transactions management and history feature. As I
            worked on creating the necessary front-end interfaces (React), I was
            able to test and influence the emerging API. After continous
            iteration cycles with feedback from the team, I ultimately presented
            the working interface to company shareholders.
            <br />
            <br />
            With my remaining time, I was also able to prototype ideas such as
            data visualizations based on the transactions and share them with
            the team as potential future features.

            Here I help researchers create bespoke experiments that are run in
            the browser (jsPsych).
            <br />
            <br />
            All the gathered data is stored in a MongoDB database and made
            available through a custom experiment management web application
            (Angular, Express). This evolving project continues to grow as I add
            new features to make it easier to manage experiments.
            <br />
            <br />
            Besides experiments, I also handle the various websites and
            documentation needed for the lab (MkDocs, docusaurus).
