          I started drawing in December 2021. I had New Year Resolutions on my

          I was (and still am) awed by speed sketch artists on TikTok, street
          portrait artists in New York, and of course Kim Jung Gi. Drawing fast,
          without sketching, and with permanent inkâ€” that's a thrill I can't get
          enough of.
