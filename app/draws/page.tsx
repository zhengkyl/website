        I started drawing in December 2021. I had New Year Resolutions on my
        mind, and I put my pen to paper right there and then because important
        things should be done sooner rather than later.

        I was (and still am) awed by speed sketch artists on TikTok, street
        portrait artists in New York, and of course Kim Jung Gi. Drawing fast,
        without sketching, and with permanent inkâ€” that's a thrill I can't get
        enough of.

        I don't have any particular direction or goals, but it might be
        interesting to tell a story through the form of a comic. For now, I'm
        still trying to figure out how to draw noses.
