My personal website made with Next.js

I use this to experiment with new stuff, so the code is pretty jank.

I'm using `@next/mdx` for mdx files. I know, I'm insane. See `next.config.mjs` for details on getting image urls and frontmatter working.

## TODO

- [ ] write more


## misc
`transformerVariantGroup` doesn't work with postcss
