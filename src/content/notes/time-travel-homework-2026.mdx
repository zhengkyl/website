For those departing from 2025, there is A LOT that needs to be done.

If you are arriving from the future, please help out by grading this homework.

## Resolutions

Here are things I'm resolved to continue doing in 2026.

1. Keep writing
   - I almost haven't written anything nontrivial since high school. I'm [really bad at it](./crafting_qr_codes). If writing is thinking, I need to think more.
   - GOAL: Write 12 nontrivial _things_. Short stories, essays, blog posts are all fair game.
1. Keep learning Chinese
   - 我最近在看一些动画和电视剧，例如《凡人修仙传》和《赘婿》。我也用中文配音和字幕玩《巫师3》以及一些抽卡游戏，但我的读速很慢还有我的输出和表达能力很拉。
   - GOAL: 写并朗读一篇文章
1. Keep learning Japanese
   - I "finished" [Tae Kim's Guide to Learning Japanese](https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/complete/) and the Kaishi 1.5k Anki deck in 2024, but I had no clue what to do after and completely stopped for a year. これはぺんです。
   - GOAL: 作文を書いて朗読する。(I translated that, 僕の日本語は下手です)
1. Keep drawing
   - Four years ago, I wanted to be like Kim Jung Gi. His fast style, drawing with pen straight-from-imagination, blew me away. Today I draw slowly and struggle with likeness, perspective, and drawing from imagination.
   - GOAL: Fill a giant sketchbook.
1. Keep learning CS
   - When I dropped my compilers course in college, I justified it by thinking "I can just do a more interesting course online--later." Later has come in the form of [CIS531 -- Compilers at Syracuse](https://kmicinski.com/functional-programming/2025/11/23/build-a-language/) and I've started by learning Racket.
   - GOAL: Build a compiler.

## Predictions

Here are things that happened in 2026.

1. The US and China have an unexpected warming of relations. Perhaps due to a common enemy. Or _lover_?

1. The Obvious Human-ai Interface Overlay is popularized. It is so named because it is _so obvious_ in hindsight and everyone wonders "How did the linear chat interface last so long?" LLMs are not bound by causality!

1. A better cure is found for a previously near incurable disease. A grassroots campaign successfully pressures the pharma company into allowing generic production.

Goodluck.
