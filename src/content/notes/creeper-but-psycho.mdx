All these creepers, I might go a little bit psycho\
Tonight no sleepin, I'm about to go mine\
Farming's not safe at night bro, there's diamonds to find, though\
Tonight no sleepin, I'm about to go mine

I mine copper, looking for diamond\
Suprise creeper, kills me in seconds\
I'll be coming back, back for my diamonds\
My precious ores, I gotta have them

No, no, my stuff's despa-a-awned\
My diamonds are go-o-one\
I keep saying, "No, no"\
Then I'm saying, "Yes, yes, yes"\
They're still in my enderchest

All these creepers, I might go a little bit psycho\
Tonight no sleepin, I'm about to go mine\
Farming's not safe at night bro, there's diamonds to find, though\
Tonight no sleepin, I'm about to go mine

"Digging straight down" kind of crazy, fall into a ravine\
Water bucket clutch and walk away\
All these creepers, I might go a little bit psycho\
Tonight no sleepin, I'm about to go mine

To fight a witch, avoid her potions\
Guard-i-ans live in the ocean\
Don't look straight at the endermen\
But when creepers come, just run away

No, no, my stuff's despa-a-awned\
My diamonds are go-o-one\
I keep saying, "No (no, no, no), no (no)"\
Then I'm saying, "Yes, yes, yes"\
They're still in my enderchest

All these creepers, I might go a little bit psycho\
Tonight no sleepin, I'm about to go mine\
Farming's not safe at night bro, there's diamonds to find, though\
Tonight no sleepin, I'm about to go mine

"Digging straight down" kind of crazy, fall into a ravine\
Water bucket clutch and walk away\
All these creepers, I might go a little bit psycho\
Tonight no sleepin, I'm about to go mine

You're just like me, you love to mine\
Diggin for ores, avoiding Herobrine\
You're telling me, strip mines are lame\
Boy, don't forget this is a mining game

All these creepers, I might go a little bit psycho\
Tonight no sleepin, I'm about to go mine\
Farming's not safe at night bro, there's diamonds to find, though\
Tonight no sleepin, I'm about to go mine

"Digging straight down" kind of crazy, fall into a ravine\
Water bucket clutch and walk away\
All these creepers, I might go a little bit psycho\
Tonight no sleepin, I'm about to go mine
