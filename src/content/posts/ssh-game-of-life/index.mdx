I made Conway's Game of Life, except it's **multiplayer**, runs in the **terminal**, and accessible via **ssh**.

```sh
ssh gol.kylezhe.ng
```

## The Idea

![game of life menu](./menu.png)

Somehow I got hoodwinked by [@purduehackers](https://www.purduehackers.com) into holding a workshop to teach Go. This was good, because it justified the previous week I spent learning Go.

Conway's Game of Life seemed like a simple interactive program that someone could reasonably code in a new programming language.

After a little work, I ended up with a small (less than 200 line) terminal application, written in Go using the [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) library made by [@charm](https://charm.sh/), and a slideshow using [slides](https://github.com/maaslalani/slides), a terminal slideshow app.

## The Workshop

![me talking](./workshop.jpg)

Not many people showed up, and I think only 1 person actually coded the program from start to finish. Having the finished project available on Github beforehand was a good idea, but the live coding was not very successful.

Talking while typing was hard even though I was very familiar with the code, and the whole experience just wasn't very engaging. People typed along or watched without absorbing much, and I just ended up talking to myself.

At the end, when someone asked what they could actually use Go for, I struggled to give a suggestion outside of "make a web server". Turns out, I'm not an expert in Go (or useful code).

Ultimately, I think the code was still too complicated for the given time and the end result was too niche.

This was a ~~canon event~~ learning experience.

Here is a super brief rundown of all the logic needed for Conway's Game of Life.

```go
package life

func NewBoard(width, height int) [][]bool {
  board := make([][]bool, height)
  for i := range board {
    board[i] = make([]bool, width)
  }
  return board
}

func NextBoard(board [][]bool) [][]bool {
  boardHeight := len(board)
  boardWidth := len(board[0])

  newBoard := NewBoard(boardWidth, boardHeight)

  for y := range board {
    for x, alive := range board[y] {

      neighbors := 0

      for dy := -1; dy <= 1; dy++ {
        for dx := -1; dx <= 1; dx++ {
          if dy == 0 && dx == 0 {
            continue
          }

          ny := (y + dy + boardHeight) % boardHeight
          nx := (x + dx + boardWidth) % boardWidth

          if board[ny][nx] {
            neighbors++
          }
        }
      }

      if alive && (neighbors == 2 || neighbors == 3) {
        newBoard[y][x] = true
      } else if !alive && neighbors == 3 {
        newBoard[y][x] = true
      }

    }
  }

  return newBoard
}
```

You might be thinking that the code could be more efficient. I also felt the urge to optimize especially after reading about some [mind-bending optimizations](https://www.jagregory.com/abrash-black-book/#chapter-18-its-a-plain-wonderful-life), but I ran a benchmark first.

The code was **waaaaaaaay** more than fast enough. I guess the real premature optimization was the advancements in hardware made along the way.

## SSH & Multiplayer

Inspired by [SSHTron](https://github.com/zachlatta/sshtron), I decided that I had to add multiplayer. The workshop was over, so there was no point, but I wasn't quite ready to let go... of my gol...

This is where the [wish](https://github.com/charmbracelet/wish) library, also made by [@charm](https://charm.sh/), came in handy. It handles ssh connections and even comes with built in middleware for [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) applications.

With a few lines of code, the workshop project became an SSH app.

```go
s, err := wish.NewServer(
    wish.WithAddress(fmt.Sprintf("%s:%d", host, port)),
    wish.WithMiddleware(
      MiddlewareWithProgramHandler(teaHandler(gm), termenv.ANSI256, gm),
    ),
  )
```

Of course, the true challenge was the multiplayer experience and debugging countless race conditions caused by my poor decision making.

Here is a diagram of the [complexity demon](https://grugbrain.dev/) I summoned. For simplicity, only one player is shown. In reality, one lobby exists for each game, which has up to 10 players, each with their own `playerState`. <span text="sm">(In actual reality, there are zero players, but you get the point)</span>.

![complexity demon data flow](./chart.png)

<div className="flex flex-col gap-4 border p-4">
`manager` controls the creation and joining and leaving of game lobbies.

`player` represents one connected user, which their own goroutine handling input and displaying the board. They send commands to a `lobby` and update their `playerState`.

`lobby` runs one Game of Life board and sends updates to all players.

</div>

I'm not proud of it, so I'll save you any further details, but I'm 100% sure I solved 90% of the possible game breaking bugs with the careful usage of a few mutexes.

## Everything Else

Although the game board has a fixed size, I decided to make it tile infinitely to fill terminals of any size and allow seamless player movement. This was hard, but only in the way math is.

I contemplated summoning more complexity demons for the sake of rendering optimization, but thankfully I gave up and just added more colors.

And months later, I gave it some polish and wrote this post.

![thanks](./thanks.gif)

I started this when I was excited about working on anything other than another web app using some Javascript framework. In fact, I ended up writing another ssh app using the same libraries to track the movies I watch. The code is at [review-ssh](https://github.com/zhengkyl/review-ssh) and the app is live at `ssh reviews.kylezhe.ng`. Suprisingly, I actually use it.

These two projects gave me a taste of Go, even if they are somewhat niche projects that don't play to the language's strengths. Here are my unqualified thoughts about the language.

- It definitely reached the goal of a being a static language that feels dynamic.
- It's nice to know that I can come back anytime and instantly understand the code I wrote.
- I don't forsee myself using Go very much. It is productive, but it does not spark joy.

Thanks to [@purduehackers](https://www.purduehackers.com) and [@matthiewstanciu](https://www.matthewstanciu.com) for the idea and motivation and fun times!
