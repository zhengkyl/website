## The State of QR Codes

When I go out to eat, and when I open my pantry. When I browse books at the library, and when I close my eyes to embrace sleep. They stare at me with square eyes and a TV static face, as if I were an overworked Japanese salaryman in a world where faces are censored with QR codes.

I took some photos of QR codes that caught my eye on a trip to San Francisco this summer.

Here are some honorable mentions.

Here are my personal favorites. They are simple, clean, yet overflowing with brand identity.

    Black, white, and circular. The flowcode branding only slightly detracts from it.

Here is a brief and incomplete overview of ways people have tried to subvert QR codes.

[Russ Cox, QArt Codes](https://research.swtch.com/qart)
By encoding arbitrary numbers in an ignored url anchor, images can be placed into the QR code without relying on error correction.

[Halftone QR Codes](https://cgv.cs.nthu.edu.tw/projects/Recreational_Graphics/Halftone_QRCodes)
This process involves replacing each QR code pixel with a 3x3 grid of pixels that best match the image while still decoding as the correct color. Also, by introducing a limited number of errors, they can further enhance visual quality in key areas.

A simpler approach involves overlaying a QR code with smaller data pixels on top of a background image so that only the center of each QR code pixel is the correct color.

[Bad Apple but it is played with QR code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPYUdjptMpk)

[Amazing-QR](https://github.com/x-hw/amazing-qr)
Supports color and GIFs.

[vCode](https://github.com/ruitaocc/vCode)
Uses color thresholds to reduce number and intensity of overlayed pixels.

[QRpicture](https://github.com/xyzzy/qrpicture)
Uses color quantization and a high-contrast color palette to maximize scannability of color images. Really good at hiding the QR code's noisy "texture".

[Micrography QR Codes](https://github.com/DiscreteKat/MicrographyQRCodes)
The weirdest of the bunch, but super cool.

## What's the deal with QR codes?

There's a 100 page PDF describing the QR code standard (ISO/IEC 18004) in detail, but here's the truth.

A QR code is whatever a QR code scanner can scan.

Here are some undocumented behaviors I discovered while making [a simple QR code generator](https://github.com/fuqr).

- UTF-8 is implicitly supported when using the byte encoding mode.
- Kanji, Structured append, EC1, and FNC1 encoding modes aren't relevant for normal use. Scanners might not even support them (I can't find generators that support them either).

Oversimplifiying to the point of misinformation, there are 2\* parts of a QR code decoder we need to swindle.

- A QR code detector (based on computer vision) gets a bounding box
- A binarizer algorithm converts an image to a matrix of on/off bits

We can do anything to a QR code as long as those two parts still function mostly correctly.

Google's scanner is part of their MLKit.
Apple's is part of their AVFoundation.

Neither implementation has available source code, not that it would do us much good.

Thankfully, the Wechat scanner is seemingly open source. It's available as an OpenCV extension. It's a fork of the cpp port of the popular zxing library.
