subtitle: ERROR copy crates failed

## The Premise

I'm building an app using the [`solid-start`](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-start) framework and I'm loading a local wasm package built with [`wasm-pack`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack) using [`vite-plugin-wasm-pack`](https://github.com/nshen/vite-plugin-wasm-pack).

## An Empire Divided

I run `nr dev` and I get ` ERROR  copy crates failed`.

My local package, located at `fuqr/pkg` failed to be copied to `node_modules/fuqr`, but an empty `node_modules/fuqr` folder is created.

I run `nr dev` again and the dev server starts correctly. The pkg is copied to `node_modules/fuqr`. Yipee!

Then, I restart the dev server and I get ` ERROR  copy crates failed`, even though `node_modules/fuqr` exists with all the pkg files.

After trial and error, I find out the only way to successfully start the dev server is to start with an existing but empty `node_modules/fuqr` folder.

## War

I can work around this by simply deleting the contents of `node_modules/fuqr` every time I start the dev server. But that gets old quick.

There's an [promising github issue](https://github.com/nshen/vite-plugin-wasm-pack/issues/10) with the same error message, but my issue has nothing to do with symlinks.

Clicking on the stack trace takes me straight to this code in the vite plugin.

```js
try {
  await fs.copy(pkgPath, path.join("node_modules", crateName));
} catch (error) {
  this.error(`copy crates failed: ${error}`);
}
```

So I guess `fs.copy()` is erroring. Except, I can't find documentation for a `copy` method in `fs`. Eventually I scroll up.

```js
import fs from "fs-extra";
```

Long story short, it's just utilities for stuff like copying directories which Node didn't have until recently. I dig around, but `fs-extra` is not the culprit either.

I even try to trigger the error by just running the problematic logic manually with `node_modules/fuqr` in all possible states of nonexisting/empty/full/, but this code executes flawlessly.

```js
import fs from "fs/promises";
try {
  await fs.cp("fuqr/pkg", "node_modules/fuqr", { recursive: true });
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e);
}
```

With no other choice, I clone [`vite-plugin-wasm-pack`](https://github.com/nshen/vite-plugin-wasm-pack) and use `pnpm link --dir ../qrframe` to use this local package in my `qrframe` project. I add a generous helping of `console.log()` to the plugin's hooks and pray.

I start the dev server, and it errors, but one thing sticks out. The `buildStart()` hook where the copying takes place runs 3 times in a row.

I know `solid-start` uses [`vinxi`](https://github.com/nksaraf/vinxi) so I look through their Github issues with a little hope. Lo and behold, someone has had this [same observation about buildStart](https://github.com/nksaraf/vinxi/issues/262). From this [comment](https://github.com/nksaraf/vinxi/issues/262#issuecomment-2011412971), we learn...

> A SolidStart app is made of three vite subapps (a client app, a server app and server functions app). If you apply a vite plugin normally, it will be applied to all three subapps, thus will run thrice.

This looks promising. Running the same copying operation (especially asynchronously), seems like a potential area for errors.

Sure enough, after crudely modifying the `buildStart()` hook to only copy files once, I can finally run `nr dev` and use the dev server normally.

## An Empire United

So the final solution (based on this [comment from the `vinxi` github issue](https://github.com/nksaraf/vinxi/issues/262#issuecomment-2011412971)) might look something like this. This way, the `buildStart()` hook that copies the files is only run when the router is `client` and not when it's `server` or `server-function`.

```js
import { defineConfig } from "@solidjs/start/config";
import wasmpack from "vite-plugin-wasm-pack";

export default defineConfig({
  vite({ router }) {
    return {
      plugins: router === "client" ? [wasmpack("./fuqr")] : []
    }
  }
})
```

Unfortunately, returning a different plugin each time causes a problem with plugins like [`UnoCSS`](https://github.com/unocss/unocss), so in my project I end up having to use a single reference for that plugin like so.

```js
import { defineConfig } from "@solidjs/start/config";
import UnoCSS from "unocss/vite";
import wasmpack from "vite-plugin-wasm-pack";

const SharedUnoCss = UnoCSS();

export default defineConfig({
  vite({ router }) {
    return {
      plugins: router === "client" ? [SharedUnoCss, wasmpack("./fuqr")] : [SharedUnoCss]
    }
  }
})
```
Thankfully, this completely works, and all I had to do was modify my vite config.

## A Happy Ending?

This is a streamlined version of the steps I took to debug an intersection of unknown expected behavior from `vinxi` and `solid-start` and unknown unexpected behavior from copying the same directory concurrently.

In reality, I spent a lot of time faffing around, trying to understand the error messages coming from the failed copy operation which changed as I messed with the destination folder. I was scratching my head as I was told the files that I could clearly see, failed to be removed because they didn't exist.

Even with projects like `wasm-pack` and plugins like `vite-plugin-wasm-pack`, wasm is a pain to work with. This bug had nothing to do with wasm per se, but it's a good indication of all the sharp edges everywhere when you try to do anything. This is not the first nor the last problem I will face. Thus it has ever been.
