**TLDR**: Other styling solutions split styles and markup (requiring frequent context switching) and force you to come up with names (the hardest problem in computer science).

All styling solutions have tradeoffs, and I like the tradeoffs Tailwind makes.

## Tradeoffs

- It <span className="text-green-500 text-2xl font-bold">colocates styles with the element I'm styling </span>, which <span className="text-red-600 text-sm">bloats the markup</span>.

- I <span className="text-green-500 text-xl font-semibold">don't need to come up with class names</span>, but I do have to <span className="text-red-600">remember new names for CSS properties I already know</span>.

- Instead of choosing from infinite numbers or colors, <span className="text-green-500 text-lg font-semibold">I can pick `sm`, `md`, `lg`, and `red-500`</span>, but Tailwind classes aren't exhaustive and <span className="text-red-600">I still need to write custom classes or straight up raw CSS</span>.

So much gained for so little. It's nearly a perfect solution.

## One true drawback

Unfortunately, classes don't compose nicely. It seems like common practice to merge classes at runtime 🤮, but with great effort, this can be done using specificity, data attributes, and CSS variables instead.

Still, nothing else comes close. ~~Tailwind~~ UnoCSS with Tailwind preset it is.


<div className="rounded-lg border p-4 bg-gray-100 mt-64">
A few more thoughts.

- [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev) is a better implementation of Tailwind for JS projects, and it also has a better VSCode extension.
  - You can group variants with parentheses like `hover:(bg-red-600 text-white font-bold)`
  - The extension underlines valid classes 

- AI is bad at styling so it's not important that it's best at Tailwind.

- I'm not convinced Tailwind classes meaningfully affect load times. Either way, CSS in JS (derogatory) probably has the best case for minimizing bundle size. See Facebook's [StyleX](https://stylexjs.com/).

- If I read another long ass essay about Tailwind from a non-frontend dev.
