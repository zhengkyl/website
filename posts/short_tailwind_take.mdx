desc: People love to hate Tailwind, nobody loves being concise

All styling solutions have tradeoffs, and I like the tradeoffs Tailwind makes. Here are the pros and cons in order of importance to me.

## Pros

- It colocates styles with the element I'm styling.

- I don't need to come up with class names for arbitrary elements which might be temporary.

- Instead of choosing from infinite numbers or colors, I can pick `sm`, `md`, `lg`, and `red-500`.

## Cons

- Classes don't override nicely. You have to add more specificity or merge classes at runtime ðŸ¤®. 

- It bloats the markup.

- I have to remember a new name for CSS properties I already know.

- I still need some regular CSS, whether it's as an arbitrary class in brackets or just in a CSS file

- It requires an extra step to generate the CSS files.

## Why Tailwind

Splitting styles and markup (context switching) and coming up with names (notoriously hard) are by far the biggest problems which every other styling solution has.

Composing styles without using `tw-merge` is annoying but can be done. The other cons are trivial.

Ergo rex.

A few more thoughts.

- [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev) is a better implementation of Tailwind for JS projects, and it also has a better VSCode extension.
  - You can group variants with parentheses like `hover:(bg-red-600 text-white font-bold)`
  - The extension underlines valid classes 

- AI is bad at styling so it's not important that it's best at Tailwind.

- I'm not convinced Tailwind classes meaningfully affect load times. Either way, CSS in JS (derogatory) probably has the best case for minimizing bundle size. See Facebook's [StyleX](https://stylexjs.com/).
