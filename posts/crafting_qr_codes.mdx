QR codes have become the defacto way to share URLs in the physical world. But for something plastered so pervasively on every possible advertising surface, they sure can be ugly.

Today, I want to dive into the craft of making QR codes.

## The Story Before the Recipe

Around 2 years ago, I had the idea to draw QR codes with chalk on sidewalks using a giant stencil. I had just learned that QR codes have built in error correction capabilities, up to 30% at the highest level, and it seemed like the perfect complement to those sidewalk chalk advertisements I saw as a college student. 

{
  <div className="grid cols-2 gap-4 font-thin text-sm text-center">
    <div>
      <img src="stencil_1.jpg" alt="bad qr code stencil"/>
      A terrible first attempt. Why did I use wood?
    </div>
    <div>
      <img src="stencil_2.jpg" alt="slightly better qr code stencil"/>
      Improved but still nearly unscannable.
    </div>
  </div>
}

TLDR; this worked poorly for several reasons. Chalk smears easily, has bad contrast, is really slow to fill large spaces, and higher error correction requires larger QR codes with smaller pixels. 

But, while designing those stencils, I did end up learning a little about how robust QR code scanners are.

At the start of this year, I started building a [basic QR code generator](https://github.com/zhengkyl/fuqr) for fun and to get more practice with Rust (i use windows btw).

I also built [a web app to quickly iterate and preview QR code designs](https://github.com/zhengkyl/qrframe). It uses my Rust library via WASM, and it's way faster to iterate with. It comes with a code editor that directly runs code in your browser to render onto a canvas. It has no safeguards or sandboxing, so please don't self-XSS yourself by pasting unknown code. Though if you do, just close the tab.

I'm using it to craft QR codes that look like this.



## The State of QR Codes

When I go out to eat, and when I open my pantry. When I browse books at the library, and when I close my eyes to embrace sleep. They stare at me with square eyes and a TV static face, as if I were an overworked Japanese salaryman in a world where faces are censored with QR codes.

I took some photos of QR codes that caught my eye on a trip to San Francisco this summer.

Here are some that shocked me in some way or another.

{
<div className="grid cols-3 gap-4 font-thin text-sm text-center">
  <div>
    <img src="sf_ad.jpg" alt="double qr codes on beer ad"/>
    Using two QR codes for a different shape. First time I've seen it.
  </div>
  <div>
    <img src="sf_book.jpg" alt="qr code on book cover"/>
    Unscannable book cover. I cracked it and found the <Sa href="https://www.istockphoto.com/vector/qr-code-gm156283521-15512938">original stock image</Sa> by <Sa href="https://www.istockphoto.com/portfolio/Oehoeboeroe">Oehoeboeroe</Sa>. 
  </div>
  <div>
    <img src="sf_logo.jpg" alt="qr code shaped like logo"/>
    Incorporated into the restaurant logo.
  </div>
</div>
}

And here are some good QR codes that I saw.

{
<div className="grid cols-2 sm:cols-4 gap-4 font-thin text-sm text-center">
  <div>
    <img src="sf_insta.jpg" alt="instagram qr code"/>
    Instagram's official QR code generator
  </div>
  <div>
    <img src="sf_uber.jpg" alt="circular uber flowcode qr code"/>
    Uber advertisement inside airport
  </div>
  <div>
    <img src="sf_maven.jpg" alt="maven retail qr code"/>
    Real estate property information
  </div>
  <div>
    <img src="sf_servy.jpg" alt="servy mobile ordering qr code"/>
    Promoting mobile ordering on ordering kiosk
  </div>
</div>
}

Notice how they all look like a QR code, but are distinct in a way that fits their brand identity.

If you want to see some counterexamples, all the pictures I took are available at https://photos.app.goo.gl/mXLhxVieRw72iCJt7.

## Legal operations

- Change color as long as contrast/brightness/luminance??? is maintained
- Invert color/invert transparency
- Rotate
- Mirror
- Multiple QR codes design

## Prior work
// TODO burger king

Here is a brief and incomplete overview of ways people have tried to subvert QR codes.

[Russ Cox, QArt Codes](https://research.swtch.com/qart)
By encoding arbitrary numbers in an ignored url anchor, images can be placed into the QR code without relying on error correction.

[Halftone QR Codes](https://cgv.cs.nthu.edu.tw/projects/Recreational_Graphics/Halftone_QRCodes)
This process involves replacing each QR code pixel with a 3x3 grid of pixels that best match the image while still decoding as the correct color. Also, by introducing a limited number of errors, they can further enhance visual quality in key areas.

A simpler approach involves overlaying a QR code with smaller data pixels on top of a background image so that only the center of each QR code pixel is the correct color.

[Bad Apple but it is played with QR code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPYUdjptMpk)

[Amazing-QR](https://github.com/x-hw/amazing-qr)
Supports color and GIFs.

[vCode](https://github.com/ruitaocc/vCode)
Uses color thresholds to reduce number and intensity of overlayed pixels.

[QRpicture](https://github.com/xyzzy/qrpicture)
Uses color quantization and a high-contrast color palette to maximize scannability of color images. Really good at hiding the QR code's noisy "texture".

[Micrography QR Codes](https://github.com/DiscreteKat/MicrographyQRCodes)
The weirdest of the bunch, but super cool.

## What's the deal with QR codes?

There's a 100 page PDF describing the QR code standard (ISO/IEC 18004) in detail, but here's the truth.

A QR code is whatever a QR code scanner can scan.

Here are some undocumented behaviors I discovered while making [a simple QR code generator](https://github.com/fuqr).

- UTF-8 is implicitly supported when using the byte encoding mode.
- Kanji, Structured append, EC1, and FNC1 encoding modes aren't relevant for normal use. Scanners might not even support them (I can't find generators that support them either).

Oversimplifiying to the point of misinformation, there are 2\* parts of a QR code decoder we need to swindle.

- A QR code detector (based on computer vision) gets a bounding box
- A binarizer algorithm converts an image to a matrix of on/off bits

We can do anything to a QR code as long as those two parts still function mostly correctly.

Google's scanner is part of their MLKit.
Apple's is part of their AVFoundation.

Neither implementation has available source code, not that it would do us much good.

Thankfully, the Wechat scanner is seemingly open source. It's available as an OpenCV extension. It's a fork of the cpp port of the popular zxing library.
