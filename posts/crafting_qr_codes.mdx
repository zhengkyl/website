QR codes are the bridge between the physical world and the internet. For this reason, they are vital to traditional advertisers, those sick bastards. Yet despite being , I doubt anyone would be suprised that QR codes were originally created as high capacity barcodes for automobile parts.

To be clear, there is nothing wrong with a plain, black and white, 2D barcode that links to extra product details or food nutrition facts.

But QR codes are increasingly used in a context where aesthetics matter. Some companies have even gone so far as to develop proprietary scannable codes to maintain their brand identity

![four proprietary scan codes](four_horsemen.png)

But even for billion dollar companies, non-QR codes are relegated to the position of party trick. Tiktok and Snapchat have already replaced their custom codes with stylized QR codes, and we, the non-billion dollar non-companies, stand even less chance at using something custom because a scannable code that can only be scanned inside a specific app is hardly "scannable" at all.

If we cannot make beautiful codes scannable, we must make QR codes beautiful.

I built [a web app to quickly create and design QR codes](https://qrframe.kylezhe.ng). It uses my own [Rust QR code library](https://github.com/zhengkyl/fuqr) via WASM, and it features a code editor that allows anyone to create new or modify existing designs.

## The Story Before the Recipe

Around 2 years ago, I had the idea to draw QR codes with chalk on sidewalks using a giant stencil. I had just learned that QR codes have built in error correction capabilities, and it seemed like the perfect complement to those sidewalk chalk advertisements I saw on campus.

{
  <div className="grid cols-2 gap-4 font-thin text-sm text-center">
    <div>
      <img src="stencil_1.jpg" alt="bad qr code stencil"/>
      My terrible first attempt
    </div>
    <div>
      <img src="stencil_2.jpg" alt="slightly better qr code stencil"/>
      Improved but still nearly unscannable
    </div>
  </div>
}

TLDR; this worked poorly for several reasons. Chalk smears SO easily, contrasts poorly, is painfully slow to fill in, and higher error correction requires larger QR codes with smaller pixels. 

But, while designing those stencils, I did end up learning a little about how QR codes works.

## The State of QR Codes

I took some photos of QR codes that caught my eye on a trip to San Francisco this summer.

Here are some that shocked me in some way or another.

{
<div className="grid cols-3 gap-4 font-thin text-sm text-center">
  <div>
    <img src="sf_ad.jpg" alt="double qr codes on beer ad"/>
    Using two QR codes for a different shape. First time I've seen it.
  </div>
  <div>
    <img src="sf_book.jpg" alt="qr code on book cover"/>
    Unscannable book cover. I cracked it and found the <Sa href="https://www.istockphoto.com/vector/qr-code-gm156283521-15512938">original stock image</Sa> by <Sa href="https://www.istockphoto.com/portfolio/Oehoeboeroe">Oehoeboeroe</Sa>. 
  </div>
  <div>
    <img src="sf_logo.jpg" alt="qr code shaped like logo"/>
    Incorporated into the restaurant logo.
  </div>
</div>
}

And here are some good QR codes that I saw.

{
<div className="grid cols-2 sm:cols-4 gap-4 font-thin text-sm text-center">
  <div>
    <img src="sf_insta.jpg" alt="instagram qr code"/>
    Instagram's official QR code generator
  </div>
  <div>
    <img src="sf_uber.jpg" alt="circular uber flowcode qr code"/>
    Uber advertisement inside airport
  </div>
  <div>
    <img src="sf_maven.jpg" alt="maven retail qr code"/>
    Real estate property information
  </div>
  <div>
    <img src="sf_servy.jpg" alt="servy mobile ordering qr code"/>
    Promoting mobile ordering on ordering kiosk
  </div>
</div>
}

Notice how they all look like a QR code, but are distinct in a way that fits their brand identity.

If you want to see some counterexamples, all the pictures I took are available at https://photos.app.goo.gl/mXLhxVieRw72iCJt7.

Since QR codes are a matrix of pixels, many have tried to encode an image into 



One way to add an image is to manipulate the input data.

For URL's specifically, arbitrary data can be added as an ignored URL anchor. This data can be calculated to precisely manipulate pixels in the QR code in limited areas. This approach doesn't rely on error correction at all, but it is limited in the images it can create ([Russ Cox, QArt Codes](https://research.swtch.com/qart)).

    </div>
  </div>
}

A more common approach is to change how each QR code pixel is represented.



One strategy, possibly popularized by the [Halftone QR Codes](https://cgv.cs.nthu.edu.tw/projects/Recreational_Graphics/Halftone_QRCodes) paper, involves replacing each QR code pixel with a 3x3 grid of pixels that best match the image while still decoding as the correct color.

{
  <div className="grid cols-2 font-thin text-sm text-center pixelated">
    <div>
      <img src="halftone_albert.png" alt="halftone einstein qr code"/>
      Example from <Sa href="https://cgv.cs.nthu.edu.tw/projects/Recreational_Graphics/Halftone_QRCodes">Halftone QR Codes, 2013</Sa>

      Created using <Sa href="https://qrframe.kylezhe.ng">qrframe</Sa>
    </div>
  </div>
}

Generally, as long as the center of each QR code pixel is correct, it can be decoded correctly. In other words, this approach is basically equivalent to overlaying the correct center pixels on top of a low resolution image (usually combined with a dithering effect). Due to it's simplicity and natural aesthetic, there are many implementations online [^1] as well as a version of [Bad Apple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPYUdjptMpk).

Moreover, the image doesn't have to be black and white or low resolution at all.

[vCode](https://github.com/ruitaocc/vCode)
Uses color thresholds to reduce number and intensity of overlayed pixels.

[QRpicture](https://github.com/xyzzy/qrpicture)
Uses color quantization and a high-contrast color palette to maximize scannability of color images. Really good at hiding the QR code's noisy "texture".

[Micrography QR Codes](https://github.com/DiscreteKat/MicrographyQRCodes)
The weirdest of the bunch, but super cool.

Perhaps unsuprisingly, they also created the first AI QR codes, which they documented in [this blog post](https://troyni.com/articles/qrcode-controlnet-zh).

Following that, Anthony Fu ([@antfu](https://github.com/antfu)) made a series of blog posts detailing his experiments ([first](https://antfu.me/posts/ai-qrcode), [second](https://antfu.me/posts/ai-qrcode-refine)), culiminating in a definite guide https://antfu.me/posts/ai-qrcode-101 co-authored by [赛博迪克朗](https://space.bilibili.com/339984/), wangcai, and [代々木](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/user/profile/5be8fb806b58b745447aab0f).

Try moving your phone away from the screen (farther than you think), and maybe increase your brightness.


[Troy Ni (@ciaochaos)](https://github.com/ciaochaos) created QRBTF, a generator used to create truly beautiful QR codes like the ones below. The original inspiration is detailed in [this blog post](https://troyni.com/articles/building-qrbtf-zh).

## What's the deal with QR codes?
Tangent -> Creating QR code that matches a string
https://marienraat.nl/hacking-qr-codes.html
There's a 100 page PDF describing the QR code standard (ISO/IEC 18004) in detail, but here's the truth.

A QR code is whatever a QR code scanner can scan.

Here are some undocumented behaviors I discovered while making [a simple QR code generator](https://github.com/fuqr).

- UTF-8 is implicitly supported when using the byte encoding mode.
- Kanji, Structured append, EC1, and FNC1 encoding modes aren't relevant for normal use. Scanners might not even support them (I can't find generators that support them either).

Oversimplifiying to the point of misinformation, there are 2\* parts of a QR code decoder we need to swindle.

- A QR code detector (based on computer vision) gets a bounding box
- A binarizer algorithm converts an image to a matrix of on/off bits

We can do anything to a QR code as long as those two parts still function mostly correctly.

Google's scanner is part of their MLKit.
Apple's is part of their AVFoundation.

Neither implementation has available source code, not that it would do us much good.

Thankfully, the Wechat scanner is seemingly open source. It's available as an OpenCV extension. It's a fork of the cpp port of the popular zxing library.
