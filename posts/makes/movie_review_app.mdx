I like organizing thoughts about the movies I watch, but I don't think the traditional rating systems makes sense.

I learned this my Web Information Search class, but no one cares about bad search results. They only care about the ~5 good results, and those should show up at the top.

I don't care how bad a movie is. I'm only going to watch decent ones. I'm not rating movies 1 star out of 5, I only care about 3's and above.

There's also the question of enjoyment vs quality. I decided to quantify this as enjoyment during vs after the experiment. For the sake of completeness, I also added enjoyment before, to quantify "hype" because often times the anticipation is better than the real thing.
