It seems that everytime I meet or learn about someone cool, there's about a 60% chance that they have learned or currently are learning Japanese. While obviously a classic case of the [frequency illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_illusion), I am bullish on Japan. 

In the land of the American language, people don't learn foreign languages. I literally cannot think of a single person that has learned Spanish, French, or German beyond a beginner level. 

After 7 years of public school french class, I went to Paris where I managed to understand "dix-sept" (my [McDo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald%27s_France)(nalds) order number) to which I responded "merci, beau cul".
