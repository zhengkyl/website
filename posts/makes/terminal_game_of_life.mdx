WIP

Workshops are hard.

I learned a lot from how bad mine was.

Thankfully, I gave a dry run, which ended up being a much better experience than the real deal.

Go is a very simple language, which is good, but it certainly isn't very sexy.

Conway's Game of Life is interesting for about 2 minutes.

It's hard to learn anything in the duration of a workshop and impossible to make anything substantial.

Live coding is both too slow to watch and too fast to follow along with.

Talking to an unfamiliar audience is mostly talking to yourself.

Practice is good, but being interesting is better.
