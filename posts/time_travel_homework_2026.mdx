For those departing from 2025, there is A LOT that needs to be done.

If you are arriving from the future, please help out by grading this homework.

## Resolutions

Here are things I'm resolved to continue in 2026.

1. Keep learning Japanese
    - I "finished" [Tae Kim's Guide to Learning Japanese](https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/complete/) and the Kaishi 1.5k Anki deck in 2024, but I had no clue what to do after and completely stopped for a year.
    - GOAL: Understand 80% of spoken words in [one piece]() of native Japanese media (movie, anime, video, podcast) on the first listen.
1. Keep learning Chinese
    - I'm watching shows like 凡人修仙传 and playing games in Chinese, but I need to work on reading speed and ouput. Especially output. 
    - GOAL: Read a significant piece of literature, write two non trivial pieces of writing, and 说更多中文.
1. Keep writing
    - Observe this blog post, but I've also started posting in [r/WritingPrompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts). It's a low pressure way to push quantity over quality.
    - GOAL: Write at least 12 short stories and 2 blog posts (any language).
1. Keep drawing
    - Four years ago, I wanted to be like Kim Jung Gi. His fast, semi-stylized, straight-from-imagination, pen and ink style blew me away. Today I draw slowly and struggle with likeness, perspective, and drawing from imagination.
    - GOAL: Using [Posemaniacs 30 Seconds Drawing](https://www.posemaniacs.com/tools/thirtyseconds), finish drawings in 30s. (It took me 120s today).
1. Keep learning CS
    - When I dropped my compilers course in college, I justified it by thinking "I can just do a more interesting course online--later." Later has come in the form of [CIS531 -- Compilers at Syracuse](https://kmicinski.com/functional-programming/2025/11/23/build-a-language/) and I've started by learning Racket.
    - GOAL: Build a compiler (via course or otherwise).

## Predictions

I don't know how to predict the future, but I'm starting now just in case it's a learnable skill. They're grouped by current likelihood vibes, but I'm predicting they will all happen in 2026.

1. Likely
    - A new war begins
        - It feels like balance of power is shifting and inevitable conflicts are coming to a head.
        - PROOF: A new dedicated Wikipedia article
    - A political death becomes a meme
        - Many such examples in recent times.
        - PROOF: A page on KnowYourMeme.com
1. Tossup
    - Qualityslop: A well-regarded title has >1 hour of AI generated visuals
        - Music videos are somewhat there. Human skill and models will improve. Longform may be possible with tools like TapNow to brute force thousands of shots. 
        - PROOF: >70 on Metacritic to account for movies, shows, games
    - AI bubble pops
        - Of course there's a bubble, but is there enough real shit to justify the Mag 7 being >1/3 of S&P 500.
        - PROOF: NVDA drops 30% from peak and stays there
1. Unlikely
    - AI phone sex gets really big
        - Roleplay is a suprisingly large AI usecase. If realistic conversational voice happens before video, audio porn could be a dark horse.
        - PROOF: A news article or story from established media.
    - Ozempic 2
        - A miracle drug for a major disease.
        - PROOF: A cultural phenomenon like Ozempic
